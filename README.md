# react16-app-template

A project template for React 16 with Typescript, and all the goodies.

### Goals

 * All the fancy "modern web app" and local dev stuff.
 * More fine-grained control and visibility than opaque options like `create-react-app`.

### Why?

I spent too many days--nay, weeks--of my life fighting against Webpack templates
that did way too much for me in ways I didn't understand. It became impossible
for me to change anything. One day I decided to write my own Webpack config instead,
and since then I've never had another problem changing something in the build.

### Features

 * Write code in strict Typescript, including JSX templates.
 * Auto-formatting.
 * Use `make` to run build commands.
